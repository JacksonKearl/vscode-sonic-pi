# CHORD CONTROL
```sonic-pi
# This part provides two rings called "chord_high" and "chord_low".
# They always contain the "permitted" notes in order that everything will be in tune.
# You can use them in other live loops to select notes.

chord_1 = chord :c4, :maj9, num_octaves: 2
chord_2 = chord :es4, :maj9, num_octaves: 2
chord_3 = chord :b3, :maj9, num_octaves: 2
chord_4 = chord :d4, :maj9, num_octaves: 2

chord_low_1 = chord :c2, :maj9
chord_low_2 = chord :es2, :maj9
chord_low_3 = chord :b1, :maj9
chord_low_4 = chord :d2, :maj9

chord_high = chord_1
